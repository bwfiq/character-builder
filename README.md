Using this to learn how to code in Rust and use GitHub actions to deploy my code to a Docker container that runs on my server!

So far:
- Implemented CI/CD for the Rust app and to build and publish the Docker image
- Implement basic web server in Rust for the backend

To do:
- Parse JSON schema from 5e tools and save it to use as options for the app
- Implement front end
- Allow generating master sheet from toptions picked
